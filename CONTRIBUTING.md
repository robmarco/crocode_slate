# Before You Submit a Pull Request

Thanks for contributing to Slate! A couple of quick guidelines for submitting pull requests:

- **Please point your pull requests at the `dev` branch.** We don't accept pull requests to `master`.
- Please make sure your contributions work in the most recent version of Chrome, Firefox, and IE.
- If you're implementing a new feature, even if it's relatively small, it's nice to open an issue before you start so that others know what you're working on and can help make sure you're on the right track.

Thanks again! Happy coding.
